# GuessingGame

hello this is a database with postgres, which is a numerical guessing game, also using a sh

# Introduction 

In this introduction I will tell you how I made the game database and what I used so that you take it into account

### We need previous knowledge of commands:
```
psql -U postgres
./name_database.sh
echo
ls
read
```
We will automate a simple process in which each time the player enters a number, he will be given instructions to know or get the number that is randomly given by the system.
